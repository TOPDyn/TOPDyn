**Python-based Topology Optimization procedure for time-harmonic vibration problems**

Check out the **Git repository**: https://github.com/TOPDyn/TOPDyn

Based on the works:

- A critical analysis of using the dynamic compliance as objective function in topology optimization of one-material structures considering steady-state forced vibration problems. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022460X18308563

- On the use of active and reactive input power in topology optimization of one-material structures considering steady-state forced vibration problems. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022460X19305516

- A strategy based on the strain‐to‐kinetic energy ratio to ensure stability and convergence in topology optimization of globally resonating one‐material structures. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nme.6374

Some features to be implemented:

- Projection filters;

- New convergence criteria;

- Passive elements.
